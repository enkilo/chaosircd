Configure and compile chaosircd from source:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/chaosircd
  make

Install chaosircd (probably you must be root):
	
  make install

If you want support for SSL encrypted connections, then you
can generate a self-signed certificate this way:

  /usr/chaosircd/sbin/mkcrt

On FreeBSD and linux there is support for socket filters, which
enables socket-based firewalling and thus blocking of connections
on the irc ports for specific addresses (those which are g-lined
or k-lined).

To enable support for socket filters on FreeBSD you have to enable
the Berkeley Packet filter by adding the following line to /etc/rc.conf
and rebooting:
	
  pf_enable="YES"
