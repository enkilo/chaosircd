chaosircd

chaosircd is an IRC daemon with commands, channel modes, user modes,
and flood control implemented as runtime (re)loadable modules. DNS and
AUTH (ident) queries are done in a single child process so as to not
waste valuable file descriptors and responsiveness. It also features a
server-server protocol using timestamps for netsplit handling similar
to TS5 (hybrid), and OpenSSL encrypted server-server and client-server
connections.
